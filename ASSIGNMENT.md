### ASSIGNMENT ###

It involves the creation of a simple iOS app that integrates a 3rd party SDK
and uses the device's camera. 

Here is the test: In regards to your experience, our test is to better gauge
your understanding of the iOS build pipeline and integration of a 3rd party
C/C++ SDK (OpenCV) Using C++/ObjectiveC/Swift the task is to manipulate a
video feed in real-time.

- Create simple application for an iOS device Incorporate the OpenCV library 
- Access the camera on the device and capture the video stream 
- Process each incoming video frame and flip the image and invert the colour
  space 
- Add some simple buttons to start and stop the capture process 
- Finally display the flipped and inverted image on the screen 
- We should be able to see the original video and the edited video feeds side
  by side 

(Optionally) 
- Use OpenGL to render the video frame on screen, and do a conversion of the
  image (flip and inversion) in shader as well as OpenCV on the CPU
  (rectifying the image to its original state) 

Deliverable: 
- A buildable xcode project 
- Read Me on how this solution works
